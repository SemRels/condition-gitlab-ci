# condition-gitlab-ci

Allows releases only when semrel is running inside GitLab CI.

This plugin is distributed as the standalone Go binary `semrel-plugin-condition-gitlab-ci`. Semrel executes the binary as a subprocess, provides plugin configuration through `SEMREL_PLUGIN_*` environment variables, provides release context through `SEMREL_*` environment variables, reads standard output, and treats exit code `0` as success and any non-zero exit code as failure. Install the binary in `~/.semrel/plugins/` or anywhere on your `$PATH`.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/SemRels/condition-gitlab-ci/cmd/plugin@latest
```

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: condition-gitlab-ci
    path: ~/.semrel/plugins/semrel-plugin-condition-gitlab-ci
    env:
      {}
```

## `SEMREL_PLUGIN_*` variables

| Name | Required | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ | - | This plugin does not require any `SEMREL_PLUGIN_*` variables. It relies on CI-provided environment state. | - |

## `SEMREL_*` release context used

This plugin does not consume any `SEMREL_*` release context variables directly.

## Example behavior

The plugin checks the CI environment and succeeds when `GITLAB_CI=true`. Outside GitLab CI it exits non-zero to stop the release.
